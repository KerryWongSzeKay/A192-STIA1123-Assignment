COVID-19’S IMPACT ON MALAYSIA’S ECOMMERCE MARKET

The COVID-19 outbreak has impacted almost every aspect of people’s lives in Malaysia.
With most people needing to stay home more, Malaysians have been adapting to both the 
outbreak and the regulations. But with the environment being so different to pre-COVID 
times, how has COVID-19 impacted Malaysia’s eCommerce industry?

Malaysia announced its first confirmed cases of COVID-19 on January 25th 2020. As cases
began increasing around February, interim Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed announced 
the Economic Stimulus Package 2020 on February 27th. In March, a significant jump in cases
was seen, which led to the Movement Control Order (MCO) being imposed on March 18th.

During the Movement Control Order (MCO), businesses and stores deemed non-essential were 
ordered to suspend operations. To limit places where people could gather, all schools, 
institutes of higher learning, and houses of worship were ordered to be closed during the 
period. There is also a restriction on entry of all foreign tourists and visitors to the 
country.

Spending habits also changed after the MCO was implemented. People began saving more amid 
more uncertainty over job security and income, and have instead been purchasing primarily 
essential goods like groceries, household supplies and even health supplements. Foot traffic
to most physical stores reduced significantly and non-essential businesses were ordered to
cease operations during the MCO.

But things aren’t all grim. Malaysians have been spending more time to ONLINE SHOPPING and have
shown more willingness to purchase items online now. Changes in behaviour such as needing to work 
from home or exploring new hobbies while staying at home also present new opportunities for eCommerce.
